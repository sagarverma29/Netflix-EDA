# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Netflix data, focusing on understanding patterns, trends, and insights regarding TV shows and movies available on the platform. The dataset includes information on various aspects such as type, title, cast, director, duration, country, and more.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize Netflix data to uncover trends and insights about the types of content available on the platform. By cleaning and preprocessing the data, various visualizations were created to explore:
- The distribution of TV shows and movies.
- Duration and release patterns.
- The relationship between different features like type, rating, and country.

The project uses Python with libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for data manipulation and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data analysis and manipulation)
- **Pandas** (for data handling and processing)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for static visualizations)
- **Plotly** (for interactive visualizations)
